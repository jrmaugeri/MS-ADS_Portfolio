### Final Portfolio Outline



To communicate my professional skills gained throughout the course I will demonstrate through a series of projects varying componenets of the program 
that have contributed to the development of my proffessional skills. When I began the program about 2 years ago I had began to just become exposed
to many elements of data-science. I had only about a year of formal experience desiging data entry systems in excel for the non-profit sector, but I was 
incredibly curious and eager to expand my data-skill set to a wide variety of methods and contexts. Through the beginning of my undergraduate career
and until present day, I have been pursuing my researching capabilities. This passion for science and proofing was what originally drew me to the medical field,
however in gaining experience in human services, I realize that the field itself needed data culture in order have a chance at providing
accurate and reliable studies that can stand the test of time.
